# QMUL Booking Application
> This application was built for the Software Engineering module as a group project.
I had the responsibility of writing all the code and implementing the APIs.
The Bootstrap design was taken from the internet.

[Link to the application.](https://github.com/catalinpit/qmulbookingapp/wiki/QMUL-Booking)

## The main functionalities:
* allow people to register as either customers or service providers
* allow people to provide/book services (e.g. haircuts)
* leave reviews to services
* pay for the services using the Paypal API
* book a slot using Timekit.io API
* other features such as user profile, users privileges and more

## Project Grade
> We managed to get 98.70% for the application (prototype code - the most important part of the project) and 80.7% for the overall project (including domain analysis, requirements elicitation, application design and prototype code).
